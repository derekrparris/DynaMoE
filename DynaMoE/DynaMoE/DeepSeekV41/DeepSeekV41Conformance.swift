//  DeepSeekV41Conformance.swift

//
//  Which parts of the port have been matched against the checkpoint's own
//  reference implementation, and which are still inferred from the architecture
//  description.
//
//  The distinction exists because the two failure modes are not symmetric. A wrong
//  tensor name or a wrong dtype fails closed at load. A wrong *numeric rule* (the
//  Engram hash combination, the compressor's pooling, a prompt marker spelling)
//  runs at full speed and produces plausible text, which is far worse: the model
//  looks like it is working.
//
//  So each such rule carries a gate here. The load log prints the unverified ones,
//  `Tools/dsv41_probe.py` is what produces the reference vectors, and flipping a
//  gate to `.verifiedAgainstReference` is a one-line change accompanied by a test
//  that carries the vectors. Nothing in the runtime branches on these gates: they
//  are diagnostics, not switches, because refusing to run at all would make the
//  first real checkpoint unusable.
